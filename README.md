## Description

_Seattle Zoo Tracker allows Zoo management to track animals at Zoo_

### User Story

_I want to log a newly-admitted animal by submitting a form with animal species, name, age, diet, zoo location, number of needed caretakers, sex, one like and one dislike._

_I want to view a list of animals I have logged._

_I want options to view all animals, only young animals (less than 2 years of age), or only mature animals (more than 2 years of age)._

_I want to click an animal to edit its name, age or caretaker_

_Extend the functionality of the app by building out the animal model to further enhance the app._

_Add custom SASS styling with corresponding Gulp tasks to compile._

_Display of the total number of caretakers needed in a day._

_Add a property that records when each animal was admitted. The user could enter a date and time, or the app can generate a timestamp._

_Expand the application to differentiate between animals' species. Group the animals into those categories. Then include a component to display the total needed caretakers for whichever species the user selects._

_Add a new master component to average the total age for each species._

_Show animals based on diet type. Then, show all animals who eat meat (carnivores AND omnivores)_

### Ice Box

_Enable user login (for caretakers and management)_

_Allow management to plan caretakers Schedule and assign it to each caretaker_

_Each caretaker can login to Seattle Zoo Tracker to view their schedule and log attendance_
